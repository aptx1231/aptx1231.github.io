## Hi, welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ¤” I am Jiawei Jiang, a graduate student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Beihang University](http://www.buaa.edu.cn/), China (UTC+8). 
- ðŸ’¡ I am also a member of Baidu PaddlePaddle Developers Experts ([PPDE](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/ppde)), a reviewer of IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems  ([IEEE TNNLS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=5962385)).
- ðŸŒ± My research interests include Spatial-Temporal Data Mining, Graph Neural Networks, and Representation Learning. 
- ðŸ’ª I am the core developer of [LibCity](https://github.com/LibCity), an open-source library for Urban Spatial-temporal Data Mining. The paper *LibCity: An Open Library for Traffic Prediction* has been accepted for the 29th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems [[ACM SIGSPATIAL 2021]](https://sigspatial2021.sigspatial.org/) conference. Welcome to our [[Code]](https://github.com/LibCity/Bigscity-LibCity), [[Paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3474717.3483923), and [[Website]](https://libcity.ai/) for more details. 
- ðŸ’ª We published a [long paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14343) for LibCity titled *Towards Efficient and Comprehensive Urban Spatial-Temporal Prediction: A Unified Library and Performance Benchmark*, including (1) a unified storage format urban spatial-temporal data, (2) a detailed review of urban spatial-temporal prediction field, (3) an introduction of LibCity, usage cases, and a web-based experiment platform, (4) a performance leaderboard for nearly 20 models and datasets and a summary of promising research directions. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14343).
- ðŸš€ Our paper titled *Self-supervised Trajectory Representation Learning with Temporal Regularities and Travel Semantics* has been accepted for the 39th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering [[ICDE 2023]](https://icde2023.ics.uci.edu/) conference **(CCF A)**. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09510), [[Code]](https://github.com/aptx1231/START).
- ðŸš€ Our paper titled *PDFormer: Propagation Delay-aware Dynamic Long-range Transformer for Traffic Flow Prediction* has been accepted for the 37th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence [[AAAI 2023]](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-23) conference **(CCF A)**. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07945), [[Code]](https://github.com/BUAABIGSCity/PDFormer).
